# Wonka
To download and configure:
Select "Code" then download as a .zip file.
Then open the .zip file and change the name of the folder inside to "Wonka" by deleting "-main" off the end.
Next, open the "Wonka" folder and open "Wonka.lua"
  Change "Charlemage" in line 2 to the mage that will be opening portals  
  Change "Charlemage" in line 3 to your mule character  
Finally, move the "Wonka" folder to your "World of Warcraft/_classic_/Interface/Addons/" folder.

To use:
Ensure you have "Intearact With Target" bound in Key Bindings>Targeting and that you have auto-loot turned off.
Create your level 1 and log in.
Click the big heart button.
Take the mage port.
1 will target and trade with your mule and drop you from the portal group
  Give the level one 1s 3c.  The macro will buy 3 tokens for the off chance you get heartbroken more than once.
2 will target the innkeeper
Click your "interact with target" binding
Spamming 3 and 4 after interacting with the innkeeper will, purchase a cologne or perfume respectivle and use it.
Find an appropriate target with a heart above their head and intearact with them.
Hitting 5 while interacing will get you the gift (or break your heart).
Check for chocolates and if you found some DON'T loot them, trade the gift package to your mule.
  It's smart to keep some Unbestowed Friendship Bracelets on your mule in case you get heartbroken.
